% Software clustering algorithms group source code entities into modules, facilitating software architecture documentation. Empirical evaluation of the algorithms, however, is difficult because there are few software systems with reference clusterings for comparison with the clusterings found by algorithms. In this thesis we propose an approach based on models that generate graphs representing software systems with built-in reference clusterings. The approach is validated through an experiment that shows that the models produce graphs resembling the graph of static dependencies between classes in object oriented software systems. Finally, clustering algorithms are evaluated through model generated graphs. It is expected that this study will increase the available knowledge about clustering algorithms, which can contribute to their improvement in the future.
